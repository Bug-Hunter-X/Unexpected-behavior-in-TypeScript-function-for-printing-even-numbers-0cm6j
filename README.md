# Unexpected behavior in TypeScript function for printing even numbers

This repository contains a TypeScript function designed to print even numbers within a specified range. However, the function exhibits unexpected behavior when provided with negative input values.  The original code lacks input validation, resulting in incorrect output or infinite loops.

A solution is provided to address this issue, incorporating input validation to handle negative inputs gracefully.
